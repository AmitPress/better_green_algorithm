## Better Algorithm
> A constructive development on the previous work named as Towards Low-Cost workload distribution...(paper)

The algorithm optimizes the incoming load from both green and brown sources.
Prioritizing green energy usage as much as possible, the algorithm cares upon load balancing of those energy sources resulting cost effective and economic energy saving.

- Saved energy helps not only our environment but also the rapid industrialization with minimal cosings.

- The `energy_dataset.csv.zip` has the actual dataset upon which the attached paper is related.
